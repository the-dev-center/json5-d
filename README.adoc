:description: Native JSON5 implementation for the D programming language.

`json5-d` is a native, high-performance JSON5 parser and serializer for the D programming language, intended to be a drop-in replacement for `std.json` with added support for JSON5 features.

== Features

* **Comments**: Support for single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* ... */`) comments.
* **Trailing Commas**: Support for trailing commas in objects and arrays.
* **Unquoted Keys**: Support for ECMAScript 5.1 Identifier keys.
* **Single-Quoted Strings**: Support for strings wrapped in single quotes.
* **Multi-line Strings**: Support for strings spanning multiple lines via escaped newlines.
* **Compatibility**: Fully compatible with `std.json.JSONValue`.
